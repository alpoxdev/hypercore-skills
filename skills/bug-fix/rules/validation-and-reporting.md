# Validation and Reporting Rules

Use this rule before claiming a bug fix is complete or blocked.

## 1. Validation selection

Choose validation from most specific to broadest:

1. rerun the exact failing test, command, route, or reproduction path
2. run the nearest unit/integration/e2e test for changed files
3. run typecheck or lint when the change touches typed or linted code
4. run build when the bug could affect bundling, runtime loading, or public output
5. perform manual QA through the matching surface when automated coverage is absent

A generic build alone is not enough when a targeted reproduction exists.

## 2. Failure handling

If validation fails:

- read the failure, decide whether it is caused by the change, pre-existing, or unrelated
- fix within the bug boundary when caused by the change
- rerun the failing validation after each fix attempt
- report pre-existing or unrelated failures with evidence, not speculation

Never delete or weaken tests, suppress type errors, hide diagnostics, or mark a failed run as passed.

## 3. Flow tracking checks

For complex flows:

- create or resume `.hyper/bug-fix/flow.json`
- keep `current_phase` aligned with the first incomplete phase
- update `updated_at` on every write
- record evidence in `diagnose`, options in `options`, selection in `confirm`, changed files in `fix`, and commands/results in `verify`
- set top-level `status` to `completed` only after all phases complete
- set `status` to `blocked` only when progress depends on external input or unsafe/unavailable validation

## 4. Final report format

Use this Korean structure unless the user requested another language:

```markdown
## 완료

**버그**: ...
**원인**: ...
**적용한 수정**: ...
**변경 파일**:
- ...
**검증**:
- `command`: pass/fail, key result
**미검증/리스크**: ...
```

For diagnose-only, replace `적용한 수정` with `수정 전 중단 이유`.
For blocked work, lead with the blocker and the next required input/action.

## 5. Safety gate

Before the final report, confirm:

- the original requested symptom was addressed or explicitly diagnosed only
- no unrelated edits were included
- user confirmation was obtained where required
- validation evidence matches the changed files and bug boundary
- unavailable validation is described as unverified, not passed
