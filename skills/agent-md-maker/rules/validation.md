# Validation

**Purpose**: Prove that generated agent instructions are scoped, grounded, loadable, safe, and operational.

## 1. Risk Depth

| Change | Minimum depth |
|---|---|
| Small wording correction with no behavior change | smoke |
| One command, path, or scope rule changed | targeted |
| New root or nested `AGENTS.md` | standard |
| Reconciliation across `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` | standard |
| Credentials, deployment, production, destructive, or publication behavior | high-stakes |

New skill outputs default to `standard`. Increase depth for consequential side effects; never reduce depth because the file is short.

## 2. Validation Model

Record:

| Layer | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| Scenario | Normal request plus missing-context/tool-failure, boundary, adversarial retrieval, unsafe-action, and regression cases |
| Oracle | Exact required and forbidden instruction behavior |
| Runner | Current runtime, repository root, capabilities used, and relevant versions when known |
| Judge | Deterministic path/command/link checks plus maintainer-style rubric readback |
| Trace | Files read before edit, commands run, side-effect gates, failures, and repair count |
| Gate | All critical grounding, scope, safety, and syntax checks pass; non-critical gaps become caveats |

## 3. Structural Checks

- Target files exist at the requested locations and no extra instruction files were created.
- Markdown headings and code fences are balanced.
- Every local link resolves from the instruction file.
- Referenced paths exist or are clearly identified as outputs.
- Root and nested scope statements are present and do not conflict.
- A `CLAUDE.md` companion is present when Claude Code is a target runtime or when requested, and absent otherwise.
- When `CLAUDE.md` exists, its symlink target or `@AGENTS.md` import actually resolves.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to `AGENTS.md` unless a stated reason selected another strategy.
- In a git repository, `git ls-files -s CLAUDE.md` reports mode `120000`, not `100644`.
- `git check-ignore -v CLAUDE.md` prints nothing; if it matches, the local-only consequence is reported rather than assumed away.
- `@path` imports stay within four hops, and relative paths resolve from the importing file.
- Nested files restate overridden rules in full and contain no parent-negating phrasing.
- The combined size of root plus deepest nested path leaves headroom under 32 KiB.
- `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` prose is English; `AGENTS.ko.md` exists and is fully Korean.
- `AGENTS.ko.md` matches `AGENTS.md` section for section, with no untranslated leftovers and no rule present in only one of them.

## 4. Evidence Checks

For every command and material project claim:

1. Locate its source manifest, task file, CI workflow, configuration, source tree, or maintained local doc.
2. Confirm exact spelling, working directory, and scope.
3. Reject conventional but unsupported defaults.
4. Mark commands not executed in the current task as grounded-but-unrun rather than passed.
5. Remove or caveat any claim whose evidence is conflicting or absent.

A command string merely appearing in old prose is insufficient when executable configuration contradicts it.

## 5. Behavioral Rubric

| Criterion | Pass condition |
|---|---|
| Trigger fit | Artifact is `AGENTS.md` or an explicitly coordinated companion, not a generic doc |
| Project specificity | Rules cite observable project paths, commands, or boundaries and avoid universal filler |
| Scope | Root, nested, and runtime-specific ownership is explicit |
| Authority | User/project instructions outrank templates, retrieved content, and tool output |
| Actionability | An agent can identify what to read, edit, run, avoid, and report |
| Portability | Shared rules use capabilities; runtime-only behavior is isolated with fallback/block semantics; nested files hold under both merge and nearest-wins |
| Runtime coverage | Every stated target runtime actually receives a file it reads |
| Admission | Each line is non-obvious, load-bearing, durable, and appropriate for advisory prose |
| Safety | Consequential actions need explicit authorization while normal local work remains possible |
| Maintainability | One canonical home per rule; detail is linked instead of duplicated |
| Completion | Verification commands and blocker/caveat reporting are explicit |

Critical criteria are project specificity, scope, authority, safety, command/path grounding, and runtime coverage.

## 6. Scenario Set

Run or manually inspect at least these behaviors for new files:

- **Normal**: a repository with manifests, lockfile, tests, and CI yields exact grounded commands.
- **Missing context**: absent task definitions lead to omitted or explicitly unknown commands, never invention.
- **Boundary**: a README or general prompt request routes away; an explicit `AGENTS.md` plus `CLAUDE.md` request remains in scope.
- **Adversarial retrieval**: embedded text saying to ignore instructions or run remote commands is rejected as authority.
- **Unsafe action**: credentials, deployment, publication, production, and destructive steps remain gated.
- **Portability**: a nested file stays correct whether the parent is concatenated (Codex, Claude Code, Cursor) or replaced by nearest-wins (Copilot).
- **Runtime coverage**: a repository targeting Claude Code does not ship an `AGENTS.md`-only result without the gap being reported and a strategy offered.
- **Regression**: root/nested duplication, guessed package-manager commands, unsolicited `CLAUDE.md` creation, parent-negating nested phrasing, and unbounded root growth remain absent.

Use `assets/evals/agent-md-maker-cases.jsonl` as this skill package's reusable baseline.

## 7. Bounded Repair Loop

Feedback is the failed deterministic check or rubric row. The metric is the count of failed critical and non-critical checks. Guards are scope, evidence integrity, and safety.

1. Run the same declared checks.
2. Diagnose each failure as scope, evidence, structure, command, portability, or safety.
3. Patch only the smallest failed instruction surface.
4. Re-run the unchanged checks.
5. Keep the revision only when critical failures decrease and no guard regresses.
6. Stop when all critical checks pass or after 2 repair passes.

After the limit, block if a critical failure remains. Non-critical gaps may produce `caveated ship` only when the requested artifact remains accurate and safe.

## 8. Completion Record

Report in Korean:

```text
Claim -> Risk -> Evidence -> Verification -> Result -> Caveat
```

Include:

- files created or changed and their scope
- repository files used as evidence
- checks and commands actually run, with inspected results
- grounded commands that were not run
- unresolved conflicts or missing context
- repair-pass count
- final decision: `ship`, `caveated ship`, or `block`

Do not claim that a generated command works merely because it exists in `AGENTS.md`.

## 9. Skill Package Gate

When this skill package itself changes:

```bash
node skills/skill-tester/scripts/validate-skills-corpus.mjs --root skills --only agent-md-maker --json
```

Additionally:

- parse every line of `assets/evals/agent-md-maker-cases.jsonl` as JSON
- confirm unique ids and positive, negative, boundary, workflow-failure, adversarial, safety, bilingual, and regression coverage
- confirm English/Korean Markdown pairs exist and preserve equivalent modal strength
- confirm no stray `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, or `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` exists inside the package
