# OpenAPI and Swagger

> Treat generated API documentation as a typed contract boundary

---
## Stable Package Baseline

As verified on 2026-08-04: `@hono/zod-openapi` 1.5.1 requires Hono `>=4.10.0` and Zod 4; `@hono/swagger-ui` 0.6.1 requires Hono `>=4`; third-party `hono-openapi` 1.3.1 requires Hono `^4.11.2` and Standard Schema ecosystem peers. Lockfile and peer compatibility must be checked before choosing a path.

- Prefer `@hono/zod-openapi` for a Zod 4 route-first API.
- Preserve an established `hono-openapi` surface rather than migrating generators incidentally; it is third-party, not an official HonoJS package.
- Do not combine undocumented plain `Hono` children and expect `OpenAPIHono` to discover their metadata.
- Schema every actual success and error status. Keep central error envelopes synchronized with runtime and RPC global response types.
- Generate the document in a deterministic check, validate references and unique `operationId` values, and diff the artifact when it is committed.
- Gate spec/UI exposure separately. A hidden UI does not make a public JSON spec private, and Swagger UI does not generate the spec.

## Core Rule

When a Hono API publishes OpenAPI/Swagger docs, route changes must update the generated contract in the same change. The contract must describe the same requests, responses, status codes, security, and examples that the runtime route actually supports.

Database rows are not automatically public API DTOs. If persistence changes affect a documented response, map ORM rows to the public response schema before publishing or codegen.

## Approved Generation Paths

| Repo shape | Preferred path |
|------|------|
| Zod-first routes | `@hono/zod-openapi` with `OpenAPIHono`, `createRoute()`, `app.openapi()`, and `app.doc()` |
| Mixed validator or Standard Schema repos | `hono-openapi` with `describeRoute()`, `resolver()`, `validator()`, and `openAPIRouteHandler()` |
| UI only | `@hono/swagger-ui` mounted against the generated spec endpoint |

Do not switch generators across a whole app unless the user explicitly asked for that migration.

## Folder Structure

```text
src/
├── app.ts
├── openapi/
│   ├── components.ts
│   ├── errors.ts
│   └── registry.ts
└── routes/
    └── users/
        ├── index.ts
        ├── routes.ts
        ├── schemas.ts
        └── handlers.ts
```

- Keep shared components, security schemes, examples, and error envelopes in `src/openapi/` when more than one feature reuses them.
- Keep feature operation metadata near the feature route it documents.
- Compose the canonical spec at the app boundary, not by copying generated fragments by hand.
- Use a stable spec path such as `/doc` or `/openapi.json`.
- Serve Swagger UI from a separate path such as `/ui`, `/docs`, or an admin route.

## Operation Metadata Checklist

Every documented operation should define:

- Stable `operationId`
- Consistent `tags`
- Path params, query params, headers, and request body schemas
- Success responses with status-specific JSON schemas
- Expected error responses such as 400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, and 500 when applicable
- Auth requirements through reusable `components.securitySchemes`
- Request and response examples that match the schema
- Deprecation or hide metadata when an endpoint should not be public

## Contract Drift Rules

| Drift | Rule |
|------|------|
| Handler reads validated data not represented in OpenAPI | BLOCKED. Add the request schema or stop documenting the route. |
| OpenAPI lists a response status the handler never returns | WARNING. Fix the handler or docs before codegen/client publication. |
| Handler returns status-specific payloads but docs only show a generic response | WARNING. Add explicit response schemas. |
| OpenAPI response schema exposes raw ORM rows with internal or sensitive fields | BLOCKED. Add DTO mapping and document the public response contract. |
| Shared auth middleware exists but OpenAPI omits security requirements | BLOCKED for public or partner-facing docs. |
| Swagger UI is public by accident | BLOCKED. Add auth/admin/dev gating or document the public-docs decision. |
| Generated spec fails linting or has broken `$ref` values | BLOCKED before publishing. |

## Large-App Pattern

For `@hono/zod-openapi`, prefer feature-local route definitions and app-level registration:

```ts
// routes/users/routes.ts
import { createRoute } from '@hono/zod-openapi'

export const listUsersRoute = createRoute({
  method: 'get',
  path: '/',
  operationId: 'listUsers',
  tags: ['Users'],
  responses: {
    200: {
      description: 'Users returned',
      content: {
        'application/json': {
          schema: usersResponseSchema,
        },
      },
    },
  },
})

export const userRoutes = [listUsersRoute] as const
```

```ts
// app.ts
const app = new OpenAPIHono()

app.openapiRoutes([...userRoutes, ...billingRoutes] as const)
app.doc('/doc', { openapi: '3.0.0', info: { title: 'API', version: '1.0.0' } })
app.get('/ui', swaggerUI({ url: '/doc' }))
```

For `hono-openapi`, prefer route-local `describeRoute()` metadata and a single app-level `openAPIRouteHandler()` endpoint.

## Version and Package Caveats

- `@hono/zod-openapi` examples commonly show `app.doc()` with OpenAPI 3.0; use `app.doc31()` / `getOpenAPI31Document()` only when the project needs OpenAPI 3.1 output and the toolchain supports it.
- `@hono/swagger-ui` serves UI, not the spec generator. Use `url` for one spec and `urls` for multiple specs.
- `persistAuthorization`, `remoteAssets.baseUrl`, UI `version`, and custom HTML are deployment/UI knobs, not spec contract knobs.
- Plain `Hono` sub-apps nested under `OpenAPIHono` may not contribute OpenAPI metadata to the generated spec.
- When mounting nested OpenAPI sub-apps, parent `.route()` path params should use Hono `:param` syntax.
- Keep header schema keys lowercase so Hono validators and OpenAPI generators agree.

## Review Checklist

- One generator strategy is used consistently
- Spec endpoint and Swagger UI endpoint are separate and intentional
- Route validators and documented schemas share a source or synchronization rule
- Database row shapes are mapped to public DTO schemas before publication
- Reusable schemas, errors, security schemes, parameters, and examples use `components`
- Operation IDs are stable and unique
- Error responses match central error handling
- RPC `AppType`/typed client shapes do not conflict with generated OpenAPI shapes
- CI or local verification lints, bundles, or validates the generated spec before publication
