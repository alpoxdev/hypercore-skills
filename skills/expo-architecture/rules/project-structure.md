# Project Structure

## 1. Choose structure from evidence

Inspect app size, team boundaries, route root, aliases, workspace layout, generated files, native-directory ownership, server/API routes, tests, and current imports. Do not replace a coherent brownfield structure merely to match this rule.

Use the smallest profile that preserves clear ownership:

| Profile | Use when | Start with |
|---|---|---|
| Compact | Prototype or small product with few independent domains | `app`, `features`, `shared` |
| Product | Multiple flows, data sources, persisted state, or several contributors | Full app structure below |
| Platform | Multiple apps, shared packages, native modules, or independently released libraries | Product structure inside `apps/mobile` plus workspace `packages/*` |

Promote a folder only after it has a distinct owner or dependency rule. Empty directories and one-file abstraction layers are not scalability.

## 2. Recommended product structure

```

This is a destination map, not a requirement to create every directory. A normal app should omit `entities`, `widgets`, `server`, `generated`, or native directories until they own real code.

## 3. Layer ownership

### `src/app`

Contains route modules, layouts, route groups, navigation options, URL/deep-link parameter adaptation, and optional `+api` entrypoints. A route imports a feature screen/use-case and remains thin. Reusable components, queries, stores, storage, and business logic stay outside the route tree because files there participate in routing.

### `src/features/<domain>`

A feature owns one product capability such as auth, checkout, profile editing, or notifications. Organize first by feature, then by technical concern inside that feature. Prefer colocating a component's styles, tests, stories, and platform variants beside the component.

Use this expanded shape only when needed:

```text
features/profile/
├── api/
│   ├── profile.dto.ts
│   ├── profile.mapper.ts
│   └── profile.queries.ts
├── components/
│   └── avatar-editor/
│       ├── avatar-editor.tsx
│       ├── avatar-editor.test.tsx
│       └── avatar-editor.ios.tsx
├── hooks/
├── model/
│   ├── profile.types.ts
│   ├── profile.state.ts
│   └── update-profile.ts
├── screens/
│   └── profile-screen.tsx
├── schemas/
│   └── profile.schema.ts
└── index.ts
```

Do not create parallel root folders such as global `screens`, `services`, `stores`, and `components` for feature-owned code. Those buckets become cross-domain dumping grounds. A global screen folder is acceptable only as an evidenced brownfield convention; new scalable work should colocate screens with their feature.

### `src/entities`

Use only when a stable domain concept is reused by multiple independent features and is more than a transport DTO. Entities must not know routes or feature workflows. Do not create an entity for every API response.

### `src/widgets`

Use only for reusable page sections that compose multiple features/entities, such as an account dashboard header. Widgets may depend on features, entities, and shared code; features must not depend on widgets.

### `src/shared`

Shared means domain-agnostic and reusable across at least two owners, not merely convenient. Group `lib` and infrastructure by concern (`date`, `validation`, `network`) rather than placing unrelated files directly in them. `shared/ui` contains primitives; product-specific composites stay with features/widgets.

### `src/server`

Use only when Expo Router API routes exist. Server-only database, secret, and privileged code must not be exported through client-safe barrels or imported by native routes/features. Add lint/import boundaries when server code is present.

## 4. Dependency rule

```text
app -> widgets -> features -> entities -> shared
api route -> server -> shared/server-safe modules
```

A layer may import only layers to its right. Same-layer cross-imports require a public API and must not form cycles. Prefer composition in `app`/`widgets` over feature-to-feature imports. When two features share behavior:

1. Keep orchestration in the caller if reuse is incidental.
2. Move a stable domain concept to `entities` if it has independent meaning.
3. Move domain-agnostic capability to `shared`.
4. Create a widget/application coordinator when multiple features must be composed.

Each feature/entity/widget `index.ts` exports only supported public symbols. Never use recursive `export *` barrels or import another module's private path. Internal files import directly rather than routing back through their own barrel.

## 5. Cross-cutting placement

| Concern | Preferred location | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Query keys, DTOs, mappers | owning feature `api/`; transport base in `shared/api` | one global `services/` containing every endpoint |
| Local feature store | feature `model/` or `state/` | one global store for unrelated state |
| Secure storage/session | `shared/storage` adapter; auth orchestration in feature | direct SecureStore calls throughout UI |
| Design primitives | `shared/ui` | feature-specific card/forms promoted prematurely |
| Analytics/logging | typed ports in `shared/observability`; event calls near owner | provider SDK imports scattered across features |
| Localization | shared i18n runtime; translation namespaces owned by feature | one huge unowned translation module |
| Tests | colocated unit tests; feature `test/` for wider scenarios; `shared/testing` for harness | a detached test tree that mirrors all source paths |
| Platform variants | beside common module as `.ios`, `.android`, `.native`, `.web` | large `Platform.OS` branches and duplicate feature trees |
| Generated API/types | `src/generated` or workspace package with generator ownership | manual edits or mixing generated and authored files |

## 6. Monorepo profile

```text
.
├── apps/
│   └── mobile/                    # complete Expo app and app-specific features
├── packages/
│   ├── api-client/                # generated or platform-neutral client
│   ├── domain/                    # pure shared domain rules, when genuinely shared
│   ├── ui/                        # cross-app primitives with explicit RN compatibility
│   ├── config/                    # lint/TypeScript/test presets
│   └── native-*/                  # intentionally owned Expo/native modules
└── package.json / workspace file
```

Do not move code to `packages/*` merely because it might be reused. Extract only after a second consumer or an independent release/test boundary exists. Packages expose explicit entrypoints, declare peer/runtime dependencies, avoid importing app internals, and document native/platform compatibility. Keep app routes and app-specific feature orchestration inside `apps/mobile`.

## 7. Naming and configuration

Follow evidenced project naming; for a new structure prefer kebab-case files and folders, named exports except framework-required defaults, and `@/* -> src/*` when supported by the actual config. An alias change must update TypeScript, Metro/Babel if applicable, Jest, lint/import rules, and all callsites. Root Expo/config files stay at the app root. Confirm current SDK monorepo behavior before adding custom Metro resolver settings.

## 8. Placement decision

For every new module, decide in order:

1. Is it a route/layout/API-route entry? Put it in `app`.
2. Is it owned by one product capability? Put it in that feature.
3. Does it compose multiple capabilities into a reusable section? Consider a widget.
4. Is it a stable domain concept shared by independent features? Consider an entity.
5. Is it truly domain-agnostic infrastructure or UI? Put it in a focused shared area.
6. Is it privileged server-only code? Put it behind the server boundary.
7. Is it shared by separate apps/packages with an actual independent boundary? Extract to a workspace package.

If ownership is unclear, keep the module close to its only caller. Premature sharing is harder to reverse than local duplication.

## 9. Migration and validation

Move one vertical feature at a time. Update routes, public exports, aliases, tests, mocks, and persisted/import contracts in the same slice. Check dependency cycles and forbidden imports after every move. Preserve generated/native outputs and user changes. Delete obsolete code only after the replacement and callers are verified.
