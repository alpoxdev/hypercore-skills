## Advantages distilled into this skill

- **Native Git first**: Use official `git worktree` behavior as the stable base; wrap it with disciplined checks rather than depending on a new package.
- **One task equals one worktree**: Popular AI-agent workflows converge on one branch, one folder, one terminal/editor/agent session per task.
- **Predictable path convention**: Tools reduce friction by computing paths. This skill standardizes on `.hyper/git-worktree/<folder_name>`.
- **Branch and folder are separate concepts**: Keep Git branch names meaningful while sanitizing folder labels for safe local paths.
- **Interactive/list visibility matters**: Good tools expose list/status dashboards. This skill requires `git worktree list --porcelain` plus per-path `git status` when listing.
- **Safe cleanup is a first-class operation**: Tools and IDEs warn before deletion; this skill requires status inspection before `remove` and dry run before `prune`.
- **Editor/session handoff reduces context switching**: Common integrations open VS Code/Cursor/IDE/tmux directly in the worktree. This skill reports handoff commands and runs them only when requested.
- **Hooks and setup are useful but optional**: Worktrunk, LazyWorktree, and Par show value in setup hooks; this skill leaves hook automation to projects unless requested.
- **Parallel agents need more than file isolation**: Worktrees prevent file conflicts, but ports, databases, dependency caches, and env files may still collide.
- **Issue/PR-driven creation is high leverage**: worktree.io, LazyWorktree, and VS Code patterns show that PR/issue/task labels are natural folder and branch seeds.
- **Global labels help humans navigate many contexts**: Par/gwq/ccswitch show that short labels and dashboards are critical when many worktrees exist.
- **Repair/lock/prune are real lifecycle states**: Official Git and IDE tools surface locked/prunable states; the skill keeps them in the operator workflow.
- **Nested worktrees are controversial**: The user-requested `.hyper/git-worktree/` convention is convenient for project locality, but IDE docs warn against nesting under the current project. This skill mitigates noise with local excludes and calls out IDE/runtime risks.
- **Cross-platform paths can bite**: GitExtensions notes Windows/WSL native path issues; avoid assuming worktrees created by one Git executable are portable to another.

## Forward-test prompts

Use these prompts to evaluate whether the skill triggers and behaves correctly:

1. "Create a worktree for `fix/api-timeout` under `.hyper/git-worktree` and open Cursor there."
2. "List all worktrees and tell me which ones are dirty."
3. "Remove the stale worktree for `experiment-cache`, but don't delete the branch."
4. "Spin up Codex and Claude in two separate branches without conflicts."
5. "Checkout PR 123 for review in a temporary worktree."
6. "Prune stale worktree metadata safely."
7. "I moved a worktree folder manually and Git is confused; repair it."
8. "Create a Docker compose environment per branch." Should route away unless Git worktree setup is only one part of the request.
