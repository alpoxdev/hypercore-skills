# SEO Audit Checklist

**Purpose**: Actionable item-by-item checklist for scanning. Use during each audit phase.

## Measurement & Confidence Checklist

- [ ] Access level recorded: live URL, local files, Search Console, analytics, field Core Web Vitals, AI citation probe.
- [ ] Each evidence channel labeled as `official`, `live`, `field`, `tool`, `lab`, `synthetic`, or `heuristic`.
- [ ] Missing live/field/probe data is recorded as `unknown` or `not-applicable` with a reason instead of being hidden or scored as zero.
- [ ] Findings include `evidence_grade`, `confidence`, `measurement_method`, and `source_tier`.

## Technical SEO Checklist
