# Client Hooks and Orchestration Boundaries

> Next.js hook guidance for client orchestration without crossing server, data, or privileged runtime layers.

## Rule Classifications

| Rule | Classification | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|
| Hooks only run in Client Components or client modules | React/Next.js fact | Add or narrow `'use client'` at the client entry point |
| Client hooks cannot import server-only code | Safety policy | Block DB, private env, `cookies()`, `headers()`, DAL, and provider secret imports |
| Hooks orchestrate UI state and client-side effects | Hypercore local convention | Apply to touched interactive UI |
| Server reads and writes use Server Components or Server Actions first | Official + safety policy | Do not tunnel privileged data through hooks |

## Boundary Rule

Hooks are client orchestration boundaries, not server/data layers. A hook may coordinate UI state, browser APIs, optimistic UI, transitions, client cache libraries, and calls to Server Actions. It must not own database access, Drizzle queries, private env, cookies/headers reads, provider SDK secrets, or authorization decisions.

Default flow:

```text
Client Component
  -> useFeatureHook()
  -> Server Action or client-safe query/cache call
  -> server-only service/DAL
  -> DB or integration
```

For initial page data, prefer Server Components and pass serializable, minimal props into the client leaf. Use client hooks for interaction after hydration or genuinely browser-only data.

## Placement

Use the repository's existing convention first. Common Hypercore local shapes:

```text
src/app/dashboard/_hooks/use-dashboard-filters.ts
src/modules/billing/invoices/hooks/use-invoice-selection.ts
src/components/data-table/use-column-visibility.ts
```

Segment-local hooks that only serve one App Router segment can live under `_hooks/` inside that segment. Cross-route hooks belong under a domain module or shared component folder.

## Hook Responsibilities

Good hook responsibilities:

- UI state, reducers, refs, and browser events
- form pending/error state and optimistic client state
- `useActionState`, transitions, and Server Action invocation state
- client cache invalidation wrappers when the project uses a client cache library
- derived view state from already-safe DTOs

Responsibilities that should stay server-side:

- Drizzle queries, repository calls, transactions, and schema migration concerns
- auth/authz decisions for protected data or mutations
- private env reads, `cookies()`, `headers()`, filesystem, and server-only provider clients
- raw DB row shaping for security-sensitive output
- Route Handler or Server Action replacement for public HTTP contracts

## Internal Order

For touched non-trivial hooks, prefer a consistent order:

```typescript
export const useInvoices = (): UseInvoicesReturn => {
  // 1. Local state and refs
  // 2. Context/global client stores
  // 3. Server Action state or client cache bindings
  // 4. Handlers and callbacks
  // 5. Memoized derived view data
  // 6. Effects
  // 7. Return object
}
```

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Hook file is client-reachable only when needed and does not force broad root-level `'use client'`.
- [ ] Hook imports no DB client, Drizzle schema, private env, `server-only`, `cookies()`, `headers()`, or privileged provider client.
- [ ] Initial Server Component data is not refetched client-side without a browser-only reason.
- [ ] Server Action calls still validate and authorize server-side; hook-level checks are UX aids only.
- [ ] Hook returns client-safe DTO/view state, not internal records.
- [ ] Segment-local hooks stay in `_hooks/`; cross-route hooks move to a shared domain/component folder.
