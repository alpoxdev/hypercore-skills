# Validation and Readback

> Completion checks for Next.js architecture work and for this skill's own maintainability.

## Project Work Validation

Run checks appropriate to the touched surfaces:

```bash
# Project and router mode
rg -n '"next"' package.json
find . -maxdepth 3 \( -path './app' -o -path './src/app' -o -path './pages' -o -path './src/pages' \)

# App Router special-file conflicts and private folders
find app src/app -maxdepth 5 -type f \( -name 'page.tsx' -o -name 'route.ts' -o -name 'layout.tsx' -o -name 'loading.tsx' -o -name 'error.tsx' \) 2>/dev/null

# Server/Client boundary and secret import checks
rg -n "^['\"]use client['\"]|server-only|client-only|cookies\(|headers\(|process\.env|NEXT_PUBLIC_" app src/app src/components src/lib src/services 2>/dev/null

# Cache, mutation freshness, and route handler checks
rg -n "cacheComponents|use cache|cacheTag|cacheLife|connection\(|updateTag|revalidateTag|revalidatePath|refresh\(|redirect\(" next.config.* app src/app src/lib src/services 2>/dev/null
rg -n "export async function (GET|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE)|NextResponse\.next\(|RouteContext" app src/app 2>/dev/null
rg -n "drizzle|drizzle.config|schema|migrate|push|pull|prepared|relations|RQB" drizzle.config.* src/db db src/modules src/services 2>/dev/null

# Proxy / env checks
find . -maxdepth 2 \( -name 'proxy.ts' -o -name 'middleware.ts' -o -name 'middleware.js' \)
rg -n "NEXT_PUBLIC_.*(SECRET|TOKEN|PASSWORD|DATABASE_URL|PRIVATE)|process\.env\.(?!NEXT_PUBLIC_)" app src/app src/components 2>/dev/null
```

Interpret grep output with the relevant topic rules; grep output alone is not a verdict.

## Skill Anatomy Validation

node skills/nextjs-architecture/scripts/validate-nextjs-architecture-skill.mjs
node scripts/validate-codex-plugin.mjs
test "$(readlink plugins/hypercore/skills)" = "../../skills"
```

Must pass:

- `SKILL.md` and `SKILL.ko.md` include routing, instruction contract, activation examples, workflow, verification, and stop condition.
- Support files referenced from the core are directly linked; there is no indirect reference chain.
- Official Next.js facts live in `references/official/`, not in long core sections.
- Current official snapshot `references/official/current-docs-2026-06-02.md` is directly linked from `SKILL.md` and used when API drift matters.
- Hypercore/repo-local conventions are labelled as such.
- Project-structure guidance handles `app`, `src/app`, `pages`, `src/pages`, private folders, shared nested folders, and no-new-direct-leaf-files under touched shared roots.
- Shared nested folders such as `src/modules`, `src/lib`, `src/services`, `src/db`, `src/server`, `src/integrations`, and `src/config` are labelled as Hypercore/repo-local convention, not official Next.js law.
- Services guidance covers DAL/service/provider boundaries, DTOs, authorization delegation, and server-only helper splits.
- Hooks guidance covers Next.js client orchestration boundaries and explicitly says hooks must not cross server/data layers.
- DB guidance covers Drizzle schema/config/migrations, connection lifecycle, prepared statements, RQB relations/tables at `drizzle()` init, and validation integrations.
- Official Drizzle facts live in `references/official/drizzle-docs.md` and `.ko.md`, not in long core sections.
- Deprecated feature-folder guidance is absent from this skill.
- Cache Components, Server Actions, Route Handlers, Proxy, env, and Server/Client boundary guidance remain current-docs compatible.
- English and Korean entrypoints have aligned trigger, boundary, workflow, contract, and read order.
- English and Korean sibling files are structurally and semantically aligned; Korean parity checks include services/hooks/db/Drizzle phrases.
- `plugins/hypercore/skills` is a symbolic link to the canonical root `skills/` directory.

## Readback Evidence

Before reporting completion, record:

- scenario name and claim being verified
- exact invocation
- binary observable such as exit code, missing-file count, diff result, or validator JSON
- captured artifact path

For this skill folder, read back the changed English/Korean sibling files after edits and verify that links, headings, and rule responsibilities match. The plugin path resolves to the same canonical files and requires no mirror sync.

## Trigger Tests

Positive examples that should trigger this skill:

- "Audit this Next.js App Router feature for Server/Client boundaries and cache correctness."
- "Refactor this form to use Server Actions instead of an internal route handler."
- "Add a Route Handler for a webhook and verify it follows the current Next.js docs."
- "Next.js 16 cacheComponents 기준으로 data fetching 규칙을 점검해줘."
- "Next.js App Router에서 src/lib/auth/session.ts와 src/services/billing/mutations.ts처럼 nested shared folders로 정리해줘."

Negative examples that should not trigger this skill:

- "Create a generic React architecture guide."
- "Review a Remix or TanStack Start app."
- "Write marketing copy for a Next.js landing page without touching architecture."

Boundary examples:

- "Make a tiny copy-only text change in a Next.js page." Expected: quick boundary check only.
- "This repo is Pages Router only and I am not migrating to App Router." Expected: shared Next.js checks, no App Router-only enforcement.
