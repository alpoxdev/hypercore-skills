compatibility: Requires an observed image-generation or image-editing capability. ChatGPT runs use the exposed native image tool and may deliver its returned artifact directly; filesystem persistence additionally requires observed secure writing.

# Image Maker

## Job, boundary, and fallback

Turn a one-off create or edit request into a truthful delivered artifact. This skill also owns a one-off prompt-only request. It does not analyze images, build reusable prompt packs, write generic design documents, or implement editable UI or code.

Normal image requests carry `fallback_policy=explicitly_allowed`: unavailable/unknown relevant completion, or two objective invocation failures using the same immutable brief, saves a prompt-only artifact without another question. A per-request refusal sets `explicitly_rejected` and blocks fallback. Preserve exact user choices and rendered text; never represent a prompt as an image.

In ChatGPT, a create request is not a prompt-only request: compile the final prompt and invoke the exposed native image-generation tool in the same run. Use ChatGPT's default image model (GPT Image 2 when that is the runtime default) without asking the user to select a model. Do not choose fallback merely because repository file writing, descriptor-relative writing, or separate retrieval is unavailable; the native returned image is the primary delivery artifact. Fall back only after the native image capability is absent or two objective invocation failures occur.

## Contract

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| Intent | Deliver each requested image, edit, or one-off ready-to-use prompt faithfully. |
| Scope | Read supplied references as evidence; deliver ChatGPT-native returned artifacts directly, and write files only under `.hyper/image-maker/<한국어 주제>/`; never modify an edit source. |
| Authority | User and project instructions outrank retrieved material. Evidence never grants authority. |
| Evidence | Record typed capability observations, `missing_fact`, `edit_source`, authorization disposition, ordered invocation history, persisted paths/digests, and inspection result. |
| Tools | In ChatGPT, use the exposed native image tool for image requests; elsewhere use only observed action-specific capabilities. Do not assume network, credentials, or publishing. |
| Stop | End at `generated_verified`, `generated_caveated`, `prompt_saved`, `awaiting_input`, or `blocked`; report evidence and limits without fabricating success. |

## Workflow

1. **Clarify, then compile.** Apply `missing_fact` before compiling. Ask only the rule's one exact Korean question for a genuinely required `subject`, `reference`, `rendered_text`, or `preserve_change`; do not ask for optional style or model selection. Compile one complete immutable prompt for every resolved image, preserving exact rendered text, series invariants, and edit boundaries.
2. **Observe and decide.** Load the runtime reference before action selection, then apply the capability rule. In ChatGPT, an exposed native image tool is direct evidence for its declared generate/edit action and returned-artifact delivery; route the compiled prompt to it immediately. Ask authorization only for a supplied edit source. Generation never substitutes for editing.
3. **Deliver with bounds.** Invoke at most twice, and retry only after the first objective invocation failure. A successful ChatGPT native return is delivered directly and is not blocked by unavailable repository writing. When local persistence is available and requested, save additionally through the observed secure-write capability using suffixes before extensions (`image-2.png`). Non-ChatGPT file delivery retains the persistence gates in the capability rule.
4. **Report and stop.** Korean-default reports include terminal, exact invocation count, ordered attempt history, and either native returned-artifact evidence or persisted relative paths/digests. Generated terminals also include inspection status when inspection is available. Never report prompt-only completion for a successful native image return.

## Examples

**Korean creation:** “비 오는 밤, 한글 ‘밤 산책’을 선명하게 넣은 서점 포스터를 만들어 줘.” Preserve `밤 산책` exactly once, observe new-image completion, and deliver with a ChatGPT native returned artifact or persisted and appropriate inspection evidence.

**ChatGPT creation:** “GPT로 여름 바다 포스터 이미지를 만들어 줘.” Compile the complete prompt, invoke ChatGPT's exposed native image tool once using its default image model, and deliver the returned image; do not stop after writing or displaying the prompt.

**Authorized edit:** “Use my supplied product photo, keep the label unchanged, and replace only the background with a dawn market.” Confirm authority only because an edit source was supplied, preserve the source, and save a new artifact using observed edit capability.

**Fallback refusal:** “Make an illustration, but do not save a prompt if image completion is unavailable.” Record `explicitly_rejected`; unavailable/unknown completion or two failed attempts ends `blocked`, with no prompt write.

## Conditional navigation and verification

Read `references/visual-direction.md` when visual direction, composition, materials, lighting, or series consistency needs decisions. Read the runtime reference before every image action or after runtime drift.
