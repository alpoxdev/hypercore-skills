# Context Engineering

Standards for designing instruction, context, tools, memory, and validation so that multiple agent runtimes — Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others — work toward the same intent.

> Korean version: [`CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.ko.md`](CONTEXT_ENGINEERING.ko.md)

## Core definition

Context engineering is not "dressing up a prompt with nice sentences." It is designing the **goal, scope, evidence, tools, constraints, and verification criteria** the model receives as an executable system. A role prompt is subject to the same rule: it is not a persona declaration but a contract of success criteria and verifiable behavior the role is accountable for.

## Core Contract

| Section | Must state | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| Intent | What the user counts as success, and as failure | Persona work and inflated role-play |
| Scope | What may be read, modified, or created | Unbounded scope such as "everything related" |
| Authority | Instruction priority and conflict resolution | Mixing user, project, and tool instructions |
| Evidence | Which sources to trust | Treating a search snippet or LLM answer as a primary source |
| Tools | When to use which tool and when to stop; ownership and verification duty under parallel delegation | Letting the model imagine tools that do not exist |
| Output | Artifact format, file location, language/tone, completion criteria | Vague completion conditions such as "tidy it up nicely" |
| Verification | Test, eval, review, and source-check criteria | Declaring completion without verification |
| Iteration | Prompt version, failure cases, reason for change | Endlessly polishing sentences that merely look good |

## Runtime-neutral pattern

```xml
<task_contract>
  <intent>What must be achieved</intent>
  <scope>Target files, systems, and blast radius on users</scope>
  <authority>Which instruction wins on conflict, and which assumptions are forbidden</authority>
  <evidence>Trusted source channels and grades</evidence>
  <workflow>Explore -> plan -> execute -> verify -> report</workflow>
  <tools>Available tools and side-effect limits</tools>
  <verification>Tests, evals, or reviews that prove completion</verification>
  <output>Final artifact format</output>
</task_contract>
```

XML tags are particularly useful with Claude models, but the point is **section separation**, not XML itself. In Codex/AGENTS.md, Cursor Rules, and Copilot instructions the same structure can be expressed with Markdown headings and tables.

## Prompt authoring contract

Write a role prompt in the following order. Follow [`references/prompt-authoring.md`](references/prompt-authoring.md) for the detailed template.

1. **Intent**: what the user counts as success, and as failure.
2. **Role as responsibility**: responsibility, judgment criteria, and forbidden actions rather than a role title.
3. **Scope / non-goals**: the read, modify, create, and external-action boundary, plus exclusions.
4. **Authority**: instruction priority, and the evidence boundary for tool, web, and retrieved content.
5. **Context packet**: source, date, trust grade, and missing information.
6. **Workflow**: explore, plan, execute, verify, report — or a task-specific decomposition.
7. **Output contract**: format, required fields, language, storage location.
8. **Verification**: which of smoke eval, source-check, deterministic assertion, or human review proves the pass.

## Instruction layers

| Layer | Example | Content | Principle |
|---|---|---|---|
| Project root | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Shared project rules | Short and strong |
| Instructions base | `instructions/**` | Shared methodology, validation, sourcing | JIT-loaded as references |
| Runtime rules | `.cursor/rules`, Codex config, Claude memory | Per-tool behavioral differences | Minimize duplication |
| Skill/command | `skills/**/SKILL.md`, slash commands | Specific task workflows | Narrow and executable |
| Task prompt | The current user request | Latest priority and concrete requirements | Resolve conflicts with earlier rules explicitly |

## Criteria for a good instruction

- **Measurable**: give pass/fail criteria instead of "well."
- **Executable**: write it with verbs the agent can act on immediately.
- **Clearly scoped**: name the target directory, files, and artifact location.
- **Conflict-safe**: give stop conditions for destructive, external, or credential-gated actions.
- **Verifiable**: state which of lint, typecheck, test, eval, or source-check is the proof.
- **Model neutral**: keep vendor-specific features in a runtime profile only.

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Problem | Replace with |
|---|---|---|
| Persona stacking | Adds tokens without real quality criteria | Translate the role into responsibility, scope, and verification criteria |
| Overusing CRITICAL | Dulls the importance signal | Emphasize only truly blocking rules |
| Listing every edge case | Wastes context and increases conflicts | Principle + representative example + verification loop |
| Hidden assumptions | Makes the agent over-conservative or over-eager | State scope and stop conditions |
| Hardcoding tool names | Fails on other runtimes | Express as a capability, e.g. "best available doc/fetch tool" |
| Improving prompts without verification | Looks better but can regress | Compare with a harness or eval cases |

**Unconfirmed**: the Cursor "Memories" feature cited by an earlier revision was not found in the current Rules documentation as of 2026-07-29. It may live in a separate document, so this is recorded as **unconfirmed** rather than absent. This document makes no claim resting on Memories.
