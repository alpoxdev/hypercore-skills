# SEO Maker

> Audit and improve a project's search visibility across traditional search engines and AI answer engines.

<output_language>

Default all user-facing deliverables, saved artifacts, reports, plans, generated docs, summaries, handoff notes, commit/message drafts, and validation notes to Korean, even when this canonical skill file is written in English.

Preserve source code identifiers, CLI commands, file paths, schema keys, JSON/YAML field names, API names, package names, proper nouns, and quoted source excerpts in their required or original language.

Use a different language only when the user explicitly requests it, an existing target artifact must stay in another language for consistency, or a machine-readable contract requires exact English tokens. If a localized template or reference exists (for example `*.ko.md` or `*.ko.json`), prefer it for user-facing artifacts.

</output_language>

<purpose>

- Audit website or project SEO in a systematic way.
- Cover on-page SEO, technical SEO, content SEO, and Core Web Vitals.
- Evaluate AEO readiness for featured snippets, voice search, and direct-answer surfaces.
- Evaluate GEO readiness for citation likelihood in generative AI responses.
- Evaluate LLMO readiness for AI crawler access, freshness, and model-readable context.
- Save prioritized recommendations and evidence under `.hypercore/seo-maker/[slug]/`.
- Update existing reports so SEO improvement history remains traceable.
- If the user asks for highest score, max score, maximum score, perfect score, or continuous improvement, run an audit to fix/recommendation to re-audit loop and keep the best result.

</purpose>

<routing_rule>

Use `seo-maker` when the main outcome is an SEO/AEO/GEO/LLMO audit, optimization report, or evidence-backed search visibility improvement plan.

Route neighboring work elsewhere:

- Page or product UI design: use `designer` or the relevant frontend design skill.
- Competitor or market research without site audit: use `research`.
- Pre-release build and deployment checks: use `pre-deploy`.
- Pure performance engineering without search context: use the relevant performance or optimization workflow.
- Broad AI search trend research without a target site or content set: use `research`.

</routing_rule>

<activation_examples>

Positive examples:

- "Audit this site's SEO."
- "Check metadata and structured data."
- "Create an SEO audit report."
- "Review search-engine optimization status and give improvement recommendations."
- "Summarize how to improve Core Web Vitals scores."
- "Optimize our content so AI search engines can cite it."
- "Check whether ChatGPT or Perplexity can surface our brand."
- "Analyze this site from AEO and GEO perspectives."
- "Keep iterating fixes until the SEO score is as high as possible."
- "Audit, fix, and re-verify until the search optimization score is close to perfect."

Negative examples:

- "Design this landing page." -> use `designer`.
- "Research competitor market positioning." -> use `research`.
- "Check the pre-deploy checklist." -> use `pre-deploy`.

Boundary examples:

- "Optimize this page's performance."
  Use `seo-maker` only when performance is evaluated through SEO/Core Web Vitals impact.
- "Research AI search trends."
  Use `seo-maker` only when the output is tied to a target site, page, or content inventory.

</supported_targets>

<complexity_routing>

| Complexity | Signals | Handling |
|------|------|------|
| **Simple** | Single-page review, one SEO element, quick metadata audit | **Direct**: write `report.md` immediately |
| **Complex** | Full-site audit, many pages, technical SEO plus content SEO plus Core Web Vitals, competitor comparison | **Tracked**: use `flow.json` for phase tracking |

Before starting, record:

```text
Complexity: [simple/complex] — [one-line reason]
Mode: [create/update/optimize]
Target: [site/page/project path]
Proof surface: [commands, browser checks, web sources, or local files]
```

</complexity_routing>

<universal_intake>

Before scoring any project, classify the audit context so this skill works across stacks:

- `target_type`: `live-url`, `local-static`, `nextjs`, `react-spa`, `docs-site`, `ecommerce`, `blog`, or `app-with-marketing-pages`
- `access_level`: live URL, local files only, Search Console available, analytics available, field Core Web Vitals available, or AI citation probe available
- `allowed_action`: `audit-only`, `recommend`, `edit-code`, or `optimize-loop`
- `measurement_confidence`: lower confidence when live URL, Search Console, field Core Web Vitals, or AI citation probes are unavailable

Do not hide missing evidence. If a recommendation is based on static files, lab data, synthetic probes, or heuristics, label it that way in `results.json`.

</universal_intake>

<artifact_contract>

Create or update `.hypercore/seo-maker/[slug]/`.

Expected files:

```text
.hypercore/seo-maker/[slug]/
├── dashboard.html      # Browser-readable dashboard
├── results.json        # Structured audit results
├── results.js          # File URL fallback for browser rendering
├── report.md           # Markdown report
├── sources.md          # Source and evidence log
└── flow.json           # Required for complex or optimize mode
```

For simple mode, `report.md` and `sources.md` are the minimum. For complex or optimize mode, all files are expected.

Follow [references/artifact-spec.md](references/artifact-spec.md) for the file schema.

For new reports, use [assets/report.template.ko.md](assets/report.template.ko.md) by default. Use [assets/report.template.md](assets/report.template.md) only when English is explicitly required.

Render order:

1. Gather evidence and write/update `results.json`.
2. Generate `results.js` for direct local browser viewing.
3. Render `dashboard.html` from the current results.
4. Write `report.md` and `sources.md` with links or file references.

When `results.json` is finalized, render the dashboard with `scripts/render-dashboard.sh <artifact-dir>`.

</artifact_contract>

<support_file_read_order>

Read in this order:

1. Core `SKILL.md` to confirm the task is an SEO/AEO/GEO audit, optimization report, or score loop.
2. [rules/seo-workflow.md](rules/seo-workflow.md) for the execution phases.
3. [references/seo-fundamentals.md](references/seo-fundamentals.md) for E-E-A-T, Core Web Vitals, ranking factors, entity SEO, and schema markup criteria.
4. [references/aeo-geo-guide.md](references/aeo-geo-guide.md) for AEO/GEO/LLMO strategy, the GEO CORE framework, platform benchmarks, and `llms.txt` guidance.
5. [references/seo-checklist.md](references/seo-checklist.md) for the practical audit checklist.
6. [references/artifact-spec.md](references/artifact-spec.md) for `results.json`, dashboard lifecycle, and workspace schema.
7. For new reports, read [assets/report.template.ko.md](assets/report.template.ko.md) by default; read [assets/report.template.md](assets/report.template.md) only when English is explicitly required.
8. When rendering a dashboard, read [assets/dashboard-template.html](assets/dashboard-template.html).
9. Before completion, read [rules/validation.md](rules/validation.md).

</workflow>

<audit_dimensions>

Check these dimensions when relevant to the target:

- Technical SEO: crawlability, indexability, canonicalization, sitemap, robots directives, response status, redirects, and duplicate pages.
- Platform policy: Googlebot, Google-Extended, OAI-SearchBot, GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, PerplexityBot/ClaudeBot when present, snippet controls, X-Robots-Tag, and optional `llms.txt`.
- On-page SEO: title, description, heading hierarchy, keyword alignment, URL readability, and internal links.
- Content SEO: intent match, depth, freshness, topical coverage, uniqueness, and readability.
- Core Web Vitals: LCP, INP, CLS, render-blocking resources, image sizing, and interaction latency.
- Structured data: JSON-LD validity, Schema.org fit, visible-content parity, entity identifiers, breadcrumbs, FAQs, products, articles, or organization markup. Do not imply structured data guarantees rich results or AI citations.
- AEO: concise visible answer blocks, Q&A structure, snippet-ready summaries, voice-search phrasing, and direct-answer clarity. Treat fixed answer lengths as heuristic.
- GEO: citable claims, statistics with sources, entity authority, author or brand trust signals, and content that AI systems can quote safely.
- LLMO: optional `llms.txt`, AI crawler access, clean markdown or semantic HTML, clear entity relationships, and updated canonical content. Missing `llms.txt` is not critical by default.

</audit_dimensions>

<scoring>

Use a transparent 100-point score when enough evidence exists:

- Technical SEO: 20
- On-page SEO: 20
- Content SEO: 15
- Core Web Vitals: 15
- Structured data: 10
- AEO readiness: 10
- GEO/LLMO readiness: 10

If evidence is incomplete, mark affected categories as `unknown` instead of inventing certainty.

Each finding should include:

- Severity: `critical`, `warning`, or `info` (use impact/effort fields for prioritization beyond severity).
- Confidence: high, medium, or low.
- `evidence_grade`: `official`, `field`, `tool`, `lab`, `synthetic`, or `heuristic`.
- `measurement_method`: scan, tool, probe, source, or command used.
- `source_tier`: `official-doc`, `observed-file`, `field-data`, `tool-output`, `synthetic-probe`, or `research-backed-heuristic`.
- Evidence: command output, URL, local file path, browser observation, or saved probe result.
- Recommendation: specific action and expected impact.
- Owner surface: code, content, infrastructure, analytics, or external platform.

</scoring>

<optimize_loop>

Use optimize mode when the user requests a maximum score, perfect score, continuous iteration, or "keep fixing until it passes" behavior.

Loop rules:

1. Run a baseline audit and write the score.
2. Pick the highest-impact fix or recommendation with the best confidence/effort ratio.
3. Apply safe local code/content fixes when they are in scope; otherwise record an actionable recommendation.
4. Re-run the relevant audit checks.
5. Keep the change only if the score or verified evidence improves without regression.
6. Stop when the score target is met, no safe local fixes remain, or further work requires external credentials or business decisions.

Do not fake a perfect score. If external evidence is unavailable, report the unknowns and the best verified score.

</optimize_loop>

<validation>

At completion, `.hypercore/seo-maker/[slug]/` should contain:

- `results.json` with structured audit results and status `complete` for complex or optimize mode.
- `dashboard.html` rendered from the latest results when dashboard output is expected.
- `results.js` for local browser fallback when dashboard output is expected.
- `report.md` with prioritized findings, score, and recommendations.
- `sources.md` with the evidence log.

Validate:

- Every critical or warning finding has evidence.
- Recommendations are specific enough for an engineer, marketer, or content owner to act on.
- Scores are derived from observed evidence, not assumptions.
- Google AI features are not described as requiring special schema, AI text files, or magic markup.
- FAQPage recommendations distinguish Google rich-result eligibility from answer-friendly visible FAQ content.
- Unknowns are explicitly marked.
- Optimize mode records baseline score, changes/recommendations, re-audit evidence, and the best verified result.
