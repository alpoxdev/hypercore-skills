name: bug-fix
description: "Use this skill when the user asks to diagnose and fix a concrete bug with a symptom, error, failing test, regression, or reproducible wrong behavior. Do not use for broad build/CI repair, security review, new features, or speculative cleanup."
compatibility: Use in environments with code exploration, editing, and validation commands; complex investigations may write `.hypercore/bug-fix/flow.json`.

# Bug Fix Skill

> Diagnose a concrete bug, choose the safest repair path, implement within the bug boundary, and verify the changed behavior.

<output_language>

Default all user-facing deliverables, saved artifacts, reports, plans, generated docs, summaries, handoff notes, commit/message drafts, and validation notes to Korean, even when this canonical skill file is written in English.

Preserve source code identifiers, CLI commands, file paths, schema keys, JSON/YAML field names, API names, package names, proper nouns, and quoted source excerpts in their required or original language.

Use a different language only when the user explicitly requests it, an existing target artifact must stay in another language for consistency, or a machine-readable contract requires exact English tokens. If a localized template or reference exists, such as `*.ko.md` or `*.ko.json`, prefer it for user-facing artifacts.

</output_language>

<purpose>

- Turn a concrete bug report into an evidence-backed diagnosis, scoped repair, and verified outcome.
- Classify the bug before editing so simple bugs can be fixed directly and complex bugs are tracked through explicit phases.
- Prevent speculative changes by requiring root-cause evidence, impact boundaries, and targeted validation.
- Preserve investigation state for complex bugs with `.hypercore/bug-fix/flow.json` using `references/flow-schema.md`.

</purpose>

<routing_rule>

Use `bug-fix` when the user asks to fix, debug, investigate, or resolve a concrete failing behavior, for example a runtime error, failing test, regression, broken request, stale state, duplicate rendering, incorrect calculation, or reproducible UI/API mismatch.

Do not use `bug-fix` when:

- the main task is repository-wide build, dependency, deployment, or CI repair; route to the relevant build/deploy skill instead
- the main task is a security audit, exploit analysis, trust-boundary review, or vulnerability fix; route to the relevant security skill instead
- the user asks for a new feature, broad refactor, style cleanup, performance optimization, or architecture redesign without a concrete bug symptom
- the user asks only for documentation, planning, or summarization

If the request starts as a concrete bug but expands into repo-wide build failure, deployment failure, security risk, or product redesign, stop the bug-fix branch and hand off with the evidence already collected.

</routing_rule>

<instruction_contract>

| Field | Contract |
|---|---|
| Intent | Fix a specific bug by proving the failing boundary, applying the smallest safe repair, and validating the changed behavior. |
| Trigger | Concrete symptom, error, failing test, regression, broken integration path, or reproducible expected-vs-actual mismatch. |
| Scope | Own diagnosis, direct code/config edits needed for the bug, targeted tests/builds, and optional `.hypercore/bug-fix/flow.json` tracking for complex cases. |
| Authority | User instructions and repo-local rules outrank this skill. Existing code/tests and reproducible evidence outrank guesses. Do not override safety gates or unrelated changes. |
| Evidence | Use error text, reproduction steps, failing tests, logs, relevant source reads, recent local diffs, and validation output. Record uncertain assumptions explicitly. |
| Tools | Use repository inspection, edits, and validation commands. Gate destructive actions, credential access, network calls, production side effects, and unrelated cleanup. |
| Output | Korean user-facing diagnosis and final report with bug, root cause, fix applied, changed files, validation commands, key results, and unverified risks. |
| Verification | Run targeted validation for changed paths, then broader typecheck/test/build when applicable or explain why it cannot run. Complex flows must update tracking state. |
| Stop condition | Stop only after requested bug behavior is fixed and verified, or after a diagnose-only request is answered, or when blocked by missing reproduction/user choice/unsafe side effect. |

<activation_examples>

## Positive examples

- "`Cannot read properties of undefined` 에러가 `/users` 페이지에서 나는데 고쳐줘."
- "최근 변경 뒤 로그인 버튼을 눌러도 세션이 저장되지 않아. 원인 찾고 수정해줘."
- "이 failing test를 통과하게 실제 버그를 고쳐줘."
- "API 응답은 오는데 화면에서 같은 카드가 두 번 렌더링돼."

## Negative examples

- "전체 CI가 깨졌는데 의존성/빌드 설정을 전부 정리해줘." Use a build/CI repair skill.
- "이 인증 흐름의 보안 취약점을 감사해줘." Use a security review/fix skill.
- "이 컴포넌트를 새 디자인으로 리팩터링해줘." Use design/refactor implementation, not bug-fix.
- "버그 수정 방법에 대한 일반 가이드를 써줘." Use docs/planning, not bug-fix.

## Boundary examples

- "원인만 분석하고 수정하지 마." Stay in diagnose-only mode and stop before edits.
- "배포 후 500 에러가 나는데 로그와 앱 코드 중 어디 문제인지 봐줘." Start as bug-fix; hand off if the primary issue is deployment/platform configuration.
- "이 버그 고치고 커밋까지 해줘." Use `bug-fix` for diagnosis/fix/verification, then use a commit workflow only after the fix is complete.

</activation_examples>

<argument_validation>

If no concrete bug is provided, ask one concise question and stop:

```text
어떤 버그를 고쳐야 하나요? 에러 메시지, 예상/실제 동작, 재현 단계, 관련 파일 중 아는 정보를 알려주세요.
```

If partial information is provided, proceed with reasonable local investigation when safe. Ask only when missing information prevents reproduction, risks destructive action, or creates multiple incompatible repair paths.

</argument_validation>

<support_file_read_order>

Read support files only when their condition applies:

1. Read `rules/diagnosis-and-routing.md` before classifying a bug, choosing diagnose-only/fix-now/option-first/handoff, or deciding whether user confirmation is required.
2. Read `references/flow-schema.md` only for complex bugs that need `.hypercore/bug-fix/flow.json`, or when resuming an existing tracked flow.
3. Read `rules/validation-and-reporting.md` before declaring completion, reporting blocked state, or deciding which validation evidence is sufficient.
4. Use Korean mirrors (`*.ko.md`) for user-facing reports or handoff notes when helpful; keep machine-readable flow fields in English.

</support_file_read_order>

<workflow>

| Phase | Simple / Fix-now path | Complex / Option-first path |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Intake | Confirm symptom and expected behavior from the prompt or local evidence. | Same, then check for existing `.hypercore/bug-fix/flow.json`. |
| 2. Classify | Announce `Complexity: simple` with one-line evidence. | Announce `Complexity: complex` and initialize/update flow tracking. |
| 3. Diagnose | Reproduce or narrow the failing boundary; identify root cause. | Reproduce, compare hypotheses, collect evidence, update `diagnose`. |
| 4. Choose path | If one low-risk fix is clear and user asked to fix, announce the fix path. | Present 2-3 repair options with pros, cons, risk, files, and recommendation; wait for selection. |
| 5. Implement | Make the smallest direct edit needed for the bug. | Implement only the selected option and update `fix`. |
| 6. Verify | Run targeted validation and broader checks when applicable. | Run selected-path validation, retry within scope if needed, update `verify`. |
| 7. Report | Report bug, root cause, changed files, validation, and residual risk. | Report the same and set flow `status` to `completed` when all phases pass. |

</workflow>

<execution_modes>

- **Diagnose-only**: Use when the user asks for analysis only. Reproduce or narrow the failure, explain root cause and options, and stop before edits.
- **Fix-now**: Use for simple bugs where the user requested a fix, the root cause is evidenced, one low-risk path is clearly safest, and validation can be run.
- **Option-first**: Use for complex bugs with multiple plausible causes, cross-cutting effects, risky tradeoffs, or more than one valid repair strategy. Track via `.hypercore/bug-fix/flow.json` and wait for user selection.
- **Handoff**: Use when the primary issue is outside the bug-fix scope. Include collected evidence and the recommended next skill/workflow.

</execution_modes>

<option_presentation>

Use this format for complex option-first cases:

```markdown
## 버그 분석 결과
**원인**: ...
**근거**: ...
**영향 범위**: ...
**복잡도**: complex

### 옵션 1: ... (추천)
- **장점**:
- **단점**:
- **리스크**:
- **수정 파일**:

### 옵션 2: ...
- **장점**:
- **단점**:
- **리스크**:
- **수정 파일**:

추천: 옵션 N (... 때문에)
어떤 옵션으로 진행할까요? (1/2)
```

Include a third option only when there is a genuinely distinct fallback or temporary mitigation.

</option_presentation>

<implementation_rules>

- Do not edit before root-cause evidence is collected.
- Do not edit before user selection in option-first mode.
- Keep changes limited to the requested bug and direct impact; do not perform opportunistic cleanup.
- Prefer failing tests or a reproduction command before the fix, then rerun after the fix when practical.
- Do not weaken tests, delete failing tests, suppress type errors, or hide diagnostics to make validation pass.
- If validation fails after the fix, keep debugging within scope; do not report success until the failure is resolved or clearly pre-existing/out of scope.
- If validation cannot run, state the exact blocker and what remains unverified.

</implementation_rules>
