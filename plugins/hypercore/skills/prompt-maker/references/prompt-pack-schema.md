# Prompt Pack Schema

Use this schema for reusable prompt artifacts. Keep keys stable when an eval harness or downstream script reads them.

## Required Sections

Every prompt pack should include identity, variables, context packet, examples, constraints, output schema, eval cases, and version note even when some values are intentionally empty with a reason.
